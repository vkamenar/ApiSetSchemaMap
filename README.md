# ApiSet Schema Mapper

This tool was originally created by Sebastien Renaud for the APiSet Schema v2. It was updated by Vladimir Kame√±ar to support newer ApiSet Schema versions, up to v6.  

The **ApiSet Schema** is an undocumented feature introduced in Windows 7. It is also available in Windows Vista Platform Update. This feature allows importing symbols
from specific implementation DLL (i.e. *kernel32.dll*, *advapi32.dll*) through Virtual DLL names (i.e. *api-ms-win-core-console-ansi-l2-1-0.dll*).  

The ApiSet Schema Mapper is a simple Python script to view the corresponding implementation DLL for each Virtual DLL.
